Highlights -
--------------
Data Preprocessing – handling data from multiple sources using merge and join, handling missing values, handling outliers, handling imbalanced dataset in classification, scaling, data transformation, feature selection, data visualization using boxplot, pair-plots, distribution plots, count plots, heatmap and visualization of independent feature and target column relationship.

Feature Engineering – Imputing missing values using MICE or replacing it with mean/median/mode or by Kmeans imputation, extracting new features using polynomial features.

Detecting outliers - using IQR method, Z-score or using clustering techniques and handling outliers by applying log transformation.

Handling imbalanced dataset in classifier using over-sampling methods like SMOTE, KmeansSMOTE, RandomOverSampler, and undersampling methods like Nearmiss, Tomek Links and Combination of over-sampling and down-sampling techniques like SMOTETomek methods.

Feature selection – PCA, using feature importance from Random Forest, forward selection, Backward selection and mixed selection techniques.

Developed solutions using supervised machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso and Ridge regression, K-Nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Deep Learning Neural networks (DNNs) and Convolution neural networks (CNNs).

Used ensemble techniques like Bagging (Random Forest), Bosting methods (AdaBoost, XGBoost) to reduce bias and variance errors.

Used Hyperparameter tuning methods like GRIDSearchCV, RandomSearchCV to get better accuracy.

Worked on model deployment in Heroku and AWS EC2 instance.

Participated in Hackathon conducted by Great Learning to predict Salary range and achieved around 98% accuracy.
